## Description and standards
In this section you will be looking at the policy frameworks and systems of value within which we develop collections. We’re getting into the nitty-gritty of description. 
*We also have an optional tutorial for those interested in a career in digital archives, in which you can explore a variety of digital tools that support the management and documentation of collections.*

### Why catalogue?
The [Small Museums Cataloguing Manual](https://amagavic.org.au/resources/infosheets) describes two main reasons why it is important to catalogue a collection.

- Enriching cultural value
- Enhancing administration

By describing a collection you are capturing essential information about its meaning, value and context. This can provide the basis for further research, or support the development of exhibitions. In the case of archives, description also helps underpin the evidential value of the collection, embedding it within a set of organisational functions and relationships.

Descriptions enable discovery. As more and more collections become available online there are greater opportunities for collection items to be found and used. Connections can also be made across collections, further enriching their context.

Collections are also assets. A catalogue or descriptive system allows that asset to be managed efficiently by supporting decisions about where resources should be applied, or how priorities should be set.

Description is a form of intellectual control that allows us to grasp the meaning and significance of collections. But it’s also a way of unleashing the cultural power of collections, freeing them to support new forms of use and interpretation.

**Task 1. Terminology**

Discuss in your group if you have ever encountered these terms: `metadata standards`, `unique identifiers`, `customizable attributes/tags`, and `controlled vocabularies`. What do you think they refer to?  Find the team-member who is in Helle's TOM class and has been introduced to Tropy and have them elaborate these concepts in the context of Tropy.

## "Describe yourself" exercise
The best way to understand metadata and standards is to start producing them. 
Stealing the idea from a colleague (thank you, Andrew Cusworth:), we will now engage in a short metadata creating exercise. Follow these steps:


**Step 1. Describe yourself in a sentence or two** 

Example: Adela is a person, her parents produced her in 1979. Her favorite book is Snowcrash.
Yoda, my name is, 814 years old I am.


What a nice if random description. You will be able to create your own.
These expressions are understandable to our human eyes and brains, but too unstructured for a computer to understand. For a computer toget the meaning you have to convert it to a structured format. One such structured format is a table that gathers the important meaningful parts of the sentences.


**Step 2. Take that sentence and convert it to a table**

```{r, results='asis', echo =FALSE}
library(xtable)
Identifier <- c("adela@cas.au.dk", "yoda@email.me")
Name <- c("Adela","Yoda")
Contributor <- c("Parent 1, Parent 2", "Parent 1, Parent 2")
Date <- as.integer(c(1979, 1206))
FavoriteBook <- c("Snowcrash", "NA")
me <- data.frame(Identifier, Name, Contributor, Date, FavoriteBook)
print(xtable(me), type = "html")
```

Ok. This table provides a *structured* way for serving information to a computer. The table streamlines, classifies and organizes the important information neatly. But, what if you are exchanging this data among different computing systems that don't all have the same programmes? You can also tag the meaningful information.

**Step 3. Make this info machine-readable**


    <name> Adela</name>
    
    <contributor>Parent 1</contributor>
    
    <contributor>Parent 2</contributor>
    
    <date> 1979</date>
    
    <book> Snowcrash</book>
    
    <identifier>adela@cas.au.dk</identifier>
    
    <p></p>
   
    <name> Yoda</name>
    
    <contributor>Parent 1</contributor>
    
    <contributor>Parent 2</contributor>
    
    <date> 1206</date>
    
    <book> NA</book>
    
    <identifier>yoda@email.me</identifier>

Convert yours too! Paste it as a plain text into the "Enter Markdown" window in https://markdowntohtml.com/ and see the line render in the Preview on the right side. (If some of your content disappears, you may be using tags that markdown already earmarked for other use (e.g. `title`)). 
Congratulations you have created a self-description using markup language that is widely machine-readable. 

Imagine you and millions of other people now wish to add the description to an Omeka repository online. For that you might need to standardize the descriptive categories among you and your friends, so that all your names appear in a tag called `<name>` rather than `<navn>` or `<title>` or so (computer interprets`<navn>` and `<name>` as totally different things). You need to  ensure that a) you are comparing apples with apples, and b) you are not making extra work for yourself by reconciling lots of different tags for the same thing. 

Finally, if you were truly contributing to an existing repository, you will need to acquaint yourself with the standard that it uses. Here is one of the most common examples:

**Step 4. Convert this to Dublin core standard**

    <record>

       <dc:name>Adela</name>
  
       <dc:contributor>Parent 1</dc:contributor>

       <dc:contributor>Parent 2</dc:contributor>

       <dc:date>1979</dc:date>

       <dc:description<Snowcrash</dc:description>

       <dc:identifier>adela@cas.au.dk</dc:identifier>

    </record>
    <p></p>
    <record>

       <dc:name>Yoda</name>
  
       <dc:contributor>Parent 1</dc:contributor>

       <dc:contributor>Parent 2</dc:contributor>

       <dc:date>1206</dc:date>

       <dc:description<NA</dc:description>

       <dc:identifier>yoda@email.me</dc:identifier>

    </record>



**Step 5. Create a record for your entire group using markup or Dublin core standard**

The result will be a sequence of records, one for each member of your group. Test them in https://markdowntohtml.com/ for rendering (remember to use plain text, and add `<p> </p>` behind individual records so as to have each person on a new line)
In your group, nominate one person as ‘registrar’. It will be their responsibility to maintain consistency and quality across the descriptions and manage the workflow between team members.


- Think about what you might need to do to maintain consistency across your individual descriptions 
– Will you have a standard set of tags and keywords? 
- How will you structure the object name? 
- Which concepts in your individual descriptions are relevant to your grop collection?

<font color="blue">
**Task 2. Post a machine-readable description of your group members to GoogleDrive**

 Select a few unique or fun or important elements that describe you. Discuss these with other group members to accomplish consistency within team. How easy is it to negotiate these describing elements? How consistent their contents?

## Standards
As you might have noticed in cataloguing your group, one of the challenges is maintaining an appropriate level of consistency across descriptions. The worksheet provides a set of basic headings, but these might be interpreted differently, and there may be great variations in the sorts of language used, or how values like places or dates are formatted.

The impact of these variations becomes greater once you try to compare or aggregate collections – how do you know you’re really talking about the same sorts of things?

This is where standards can be useful. Standards define shared practices and meanings.

We’re lucky in the cultural heritage sector because we have LOTS AND LOTS of standards! (Ok, so maybe that’s not a good thing?)

There’s a lot of truth to the [XKCD cartoon](https://xkcd.com/927) (which must be shown as part of any discussion about standards).

![](../images/xkcd927.png)
XKCD Standards

Now, have a look at [Seeing Standards](http://jennriley.com/metadatamap/). It’s quite scary – 105 different standards are being used in the cultural heritage sector.

But fear not! You’ll probably only ever encounter a small number of these, and in many cases you’ll be using them without even knowing it.

Standards support the description of collections in a variety of ways.

- *Forming frameworks* – Standards can define the basic practices which constitute a field of activity. For example the National Standards for Australian Museums and Galleries set out the responsibilities, expectations and activities that make a museum a museum. There are similar sorts of standards for archives. These sorts of standards can be used to review current practice or frame organisational policies.
- *Defining descriptions* – Standards can define what information that should be captured about collections and how it should be structured. For example the General International Standard Archival Description (ISAD(G)) sets out the basic principles guiding the arrangement and description of archives.
- *Enabling exchange* – Standards can describe how collection information can be packaged and shared to support aggregation or reuse. For example Dublin Core sets out a basic set of terms that are widely used to share collection information.
Another form of standard are authority lists or controlled vocabularies. These may be simple, flat lists of terms, or complex hierarchies. The widely-used Subject Headings from the Library of Congress are an example of this sort of standard. For a visualisation of the complexity of the subject headings system see the [LoC Subject Headings Galaxy](http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html).

As I mentioned, most of the time you’ll be using standards without even knowing it. On the Small Museums Cataloguing Manual website you might have noticed that it states the manual ‘accords with Benchmark A2.4.2 of the National Standards for Australian Museums and Galleries’. The standard is being used to give context and authority to the manual.

Sometimes standards are used in the design of tools. The archival management system AtoM (or AccessToMemory) is designed to meet the requirements of the ISAD(G) standard. If you pursue the path of a digital archivist, you will likely encounter the digital tool Omeka. The core fields in Omeka are based on the Dublin Core standard.

Here are a few standards that you might meet:

- [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) – for general collection discovery
- [METS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/) (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard) – for capturing metadata within a digital library, often combined with ALTO to represent information about digitised objects.
- [ALTO](https://www.loc.gov/standards/alto/) – for describing the structure or layout of text objects, such as the position of articles on a newspaper page.
- [TEI](https://tei-c.org/index.xml) (Text Encoding Initiative) – for representing the structure and content of digital texts.
- [CIDOC-CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/) – a framework for representing cultural heritage information
- [EAD](http://www.loc.gov/ead/) (Encoded Archival Description) – for preparing archival finding aids
- [EAC-CPF](https://eac.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/) (Encoded Archival Context: Corporate bodies, Persons, Families) – for describing people and organisations associated with archival collections
- [OAI-PMH](https://www.openarchives.org/pmh/) (Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting) – for sharing cultural heritage collections in a harvestable, machine-readable form

## Standards are not standard
But standards and authorities are not neutral, they reflect a particular worldview. Some examples can be seen here:

- [A brief history of homophobia in Dewey Decimal classification](https://overland.org.au/2015/07/a-brief-history-of-homophobia-in-dewey-decimal-classification/)
- [Controversy over the use of terms ‘alien’ and ‘illegal immigrant’ in library subject headings](https://www.mediamatters.org/new-york-times/republicans-slammed-trying-force-library-congress-use-anti-immigrant-language?redirect_source=/blog/2016/06/20/republicans-slammed-trying-force-library-congress-use-anti-immigrant-language/211063)
In both cases we can see that the systems themselves have evolved over time in response to community attitudes. It’s important to recognise that standards can, and probably should, change.

Standards creating organisations can also seek to involve and represent a range of perspectives. For example, the National Library of New Zealand is developing a set of Maori Subject Headings that reflect a Maori world view.

**Task 3: Evaluate your own and two other groups' self-description products**

Look at two other groups member descriptions on GoogleDrive. Discuss with your group: Are all descriptors/tags neutral, easily understandable and non-ambiguous? What view of the world and individual do they reflect? 
Render the group descriptions in https://markdowntohtml.com/ and review the consistency of their contents: Can you exchange data easily with these other groups? What would you need to do to have a standardize output? Answer these question in 200 words. (Include observations from Exercise 2 if relevant)
